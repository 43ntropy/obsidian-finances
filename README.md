# Obsidian Financial Tracker

This is a simple financial tracker for Obsidian, designed to help you manage your finances effectively.

Note that this plugin is still in development and may not be fully functional yet, I'm commited to preventing any financial data loss over updates but, as the plugin is still an enbrional stage, i could not guarantee that.

If you have any suggestions or feature ideas, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

## Features
- Track and categorize your expenses
- Track loans and split expenses with and from other people
- Write balance variations in daily notes

## Future Improvements
1. Improve the UI with a custom widget
2. Add support to MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL (Keeping offline support)
3. Integrate with bank APIs for automatic transaction import
4. Add support for multiple currencies
5. Integrate investment tracking features (requires feature 4)
